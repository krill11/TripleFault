/**
 * This routine determines the effective forward offset for the lateral tracking wheel.
 * The procedure executes a point turn at a given angle for a certain number of trials,
 * along with a specified delay in milliseconds. The purpose of this is to track the
 * change in the y position during the turn. The offset, or distance, of the lateral tracking
 * wheel from the center or rotation allows the wheel to spin during a point turn, leading
 * to an incorrect measurement for the y position. This creates an arc around around
 * the center of rotation with an arc length of change in y and a radius equal to the forward
 * offset. We can compute this offset by calculating (change in y position) / (change in heading)
 * which returns the radius if the angle (change in heading) is in radians. This is based
 * on the arc length formula of length = theta * radius.
 *
 * To run this routine, simply adjust the desired angle and specify the number of trials
 * and the desired delay. Then, run the procedure. Once it finishes, it will print the
 * average of all the calculated forward offsets derived from the calculation. This calculated
 * forward offset is then added onto the current forward offset to produce an overall estimate
 * for the forward offset. You can run this procedure as many times as necessary until a
 * satisfactory result is produced.
